# Extra Traefik configs

This directory contains extra configurations for Traefik. They are not necessary for the basic setup, but they can be useful for more advanced use cases.

Place the files under /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/manifests in the server. K3s will automatically pick it up and apply it to Traefik.
